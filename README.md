# Exploit Analysis and Patching Lab

This is the public-facing version of UW CSE 484's final project.

In this lab, students are given an HTTP server (`tinyserv`) written in C (~1000
LoC), and several exploits that violate the security properties of
that server.

Students are asked to first root-cause the exploit examples to
identify the underlying vulnerability(s) and explain why the exploit
works.

Then, they write patches (3-20 LoC per-patch expected) to fix those bugs.

The lab includes handouts, example solutions, rubrics, and a full test
suite compatible with either Gradescope or a stand-alone server for
the course.

## More information

See the lab handout PDF included in this repository for an example of
what we hand out to students starting on the lab.

## Availability

Unfortunately, making the lab available completely publicly would
likely result in solutions also becoming public.

If you are an instructor for a computer security course, feel free to contact
me and I can give you access to the private repository:
